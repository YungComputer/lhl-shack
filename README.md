# shack

Shack is an app to help roommates live harmoniously together by creating and generating a Roommate Agreement. Users can create an account, a household, and roommate agreements with their housemates. Shack also displays your upcoming bills, household duties, and it also has a message board, so users can post bulletins for the household to see.
